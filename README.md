# classification
A hands-on exploration of binary and multi-class classification using logistic regression in Scikit-learn, applied to real-world medical datasetsâ€”featuring breast cancer diagnosis (Wisconsin dataset) and iris species prediction. Includes sigmoid functions, decision boundaries, train-test splitting with stratification, model evaluation, etc..

## Notebooks

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that walk through the fundamentals of logistic regression for classification tasks.

- **`sigmoid.ipynb`**: Introduces the sigmoid function, the core of logistic regression. It visualizes how different parameters affect the shape and position of the sigmoid curve.

- **`logistic_regression.ipynb`**: A basic introduction to using `LogisticRegression` from Scikit-learn. It covers training a simple model, making predictions (both class and probability), and inspecting the model's learned coefficients and intercept.

- **`decision_boundary.ipynb`**: Visualizes the decision boundary for a logistic regression model in both 1D and 2D. This notebook helps to understand how the sigmoid function's output is used to classify data points and what the decision boundary represents.

- **`train_test_split.ipynb`**: Explains the importance of splitting data into training and testing sets. It demonstrates the difference between a simple split and a stratified split, highlighting the importance of stratification for imbalanced datasets.

- **`ex05_prediction.ipynb`**: A practical example of building a logistic regression model to predict breast cancer using the Wisconsin dataset. This notebook covers:
  - Data loading and preprocessing (handling missing values).
  - The concept of a baseline model.
  - Train-test splitting with stratification.
  - Model training and evaluation using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

- **`multi_class.ipynb`**: Demonstrates how to extend logistic regression to handle multi-class problems using the Iris dataset. It implements the One-vs-Rest (OvR) strategy from scratch and compares the results to Scikit-learn's built-in multi-class support.
